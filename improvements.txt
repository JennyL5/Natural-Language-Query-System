Part E: Limitations of the system

From my experience of playing with the completed system, I have discovered that the system
does not handle sentences with complex sentence structures very well.  
Modelling agreement is important to generate grammatically correct text in Natural Laguages.
Agreement can be useful for resolving ambiguity. English has agreement, for example verbs agree 
in person and number with their subjects. There should have a distinct meaning representation,
for example duck for two meanings, hence the ambiguity in the statements. In addition, the rules in the 
completed system does not capture all the different sentence structures in the English language. There
should exist meaning representations for sentences with same meaning should be convertible into the same
canonical form to show their equivalence. In addition, when running the complete system it does take some time, 
this is because of some functions having to search through the Brown corpus containing approximately 1 million
word tokens. And according to Zipf's law, there is a very small number of very common words, and there is a 
very large amount of infrequent words. More than 40% of the word tokens are ambiguous. So with the 
Hidden Markov models can find the tag sequence for a given word sequence. The Viterbi's algorithm canbe used to 
efficiently find the most likely tag sequence by calculating the transition and emission probability.
