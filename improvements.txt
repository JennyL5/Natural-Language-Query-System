Part E: Limitations of the system

From your experience of playing with the completed system, you may discover features
that you may feel could be confusing or misleading for users. In a plain text file
improvements.txt, write a short paragraph explaining at least one way in which one
might wish to improve the current system without introducing any major new extensions
to the language it covers. Also explain whether you think such an improvement would
be easy or difficult to implement, given the material you have learned in the course.
Justify your answer.
Greater credit will be given for points that are not simply superficial features of the
implementation, but engage with the ideas covered by the course.
